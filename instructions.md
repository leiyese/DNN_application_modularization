**Virtual Environment Recommendation:**

*   **Conda:**
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Manages Python versions *and* Python packages.
        *   Excels at handling complex binary dependencies, especially for scientific computing and ML libraries (like MKL, CUDA, cuDNN). This is crucial if you plan to use GPU acceleration locally in VSCode.
        *   Creates truly isolated environments.
        *   Widely used in the data science/ML community, so good support and many packages are readily available through conda-forge.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   Can be a bit heavier than `venv`.
        *   Sometimes `conda install` might lag behind `pip` for the very latest package versions (though `pip` can be used within a conda environment).



**Recommendation:** **Use Conda for local development in VSCode.** It will provide the most robust and hassle-free experience, especially if you intend to leverage local GPUs. You can still use `pip install -r requirements.txt` *inside* your activated conda environment if some packages are only on PyPI or you prefer pip's resolution for certain things.

For **Google Colab**, you don't manage the environment in the same way. Colab provides a pre-configured environment. You'll primarily use `!pip install` for any packages not already included or if you need specific versions. Your `requirements.txt` will be key for ensuring consistency in package versions between your local Conda env and Colab.

**Project Plan (4 Parts):**

This is a great way to structure the development. Here's a potential 4-part plan, building iteratively:

**Part 1: Foundation & Data Pipeline Setup**

*   **Goal:** Establish the project structure, configuration, and a basic data loading and preprocessing pipeline.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Project Setup:**
        *   Create the main project directory (`dynamic_dnn_trainer/`).
        *   Initialize Git repository.
        *   Set up the Conda environment locally (`conda create -n dnn_env python=3.9 -y`, then `conda activate dnn_env`).
        *   Create the initial `requirements.txt` (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` or `torch`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
        *   Create the directory structure outlined previously (`src/`, `notebooks/`, `data/`, `outputs/`).
    2.  **Configuration Module (`src/config.py`):**
        *   Define initial configuration parameters for data paths, a sample dataset, and basic preprocessing.
    3.  **Data Ingestion Module (`src/data_ingestion/loader.py`):**
        *   Implement a function to load a sample dataset (e.g., a CSV file). Make it flexible enough to take file paths from the config.
    4.  **Basic Preprocessing Module (`src/preprocessing/transformers.py`):**
        *   Implement basic functions:
            *   Train/test split.
            *   Numerical scaling (e.g., StandardScaler).
            *   Categorical encoding (e.g., OneHotEncoder).
        *   Ensure these functions can be configured (e.g., which columns to scale/encode).
    5.  **Initial Colab Notebook (`notebooks/training_workflow.ipynb`):**
        *   Set up Colab to clone the repo and access `src` modules.
        *   Test loading data and applying preprocessing steps using the created modules.
        *   Perform some initial EDA within the notebook using functions from `src/eda/exploratory_analysis.py` (even if this module is very basic initially).
    6.  **Initial `main.py`:**
        *   Create a basic `main.py` that can orchestrate loading and preprocessing data based on the config file (for local testing in VSCode).
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Working project structure.
    *   Ability to load and preprocess a sample dataset both locally and in Colab using the modular code.
    *   Initial configuration system.

**Part 2: Core DNN Modeling & Training**

*   **Goal:** Implement the DNN model building and training loop.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **DNN Builder Module (`src/modeling/dnn_builder.py`):**
        *   Create a function to dynamically build a Keras/TensorFlow (or PyTorch) sequential model based on parameters from `config.py` (e.g., number of layers, units per layer, activation functions, dropout rates).
        *   Implement model compilation (optimizer, loss function, metrics from config).
    2.  **Trainer Module (`src/modeling/trainer.py`):**
        *   Implement a function to train the model.
        *   Include basic Keras callbacks: `ModelCheckpoint` (to save the best model), `EarlyStopping`, and capturing `History` for loss/accuracy.
        *   Function to save the trained model and training history.
    3.  **Integrate into Colab Notebook & `main.py`:**
        *   Update the notebook and `main.py` to:
            *   Build the DNN model using `dnn_builder`.
            *   Train the model using `trainer`.
            *   Save the model and history.
    4.  **Basic Evaluation Plotting (`src/evaluation/plots.py`):**
        *   Implement functions to plot:
            *   Loss over epochs.
            *   Accuracy over epochs (using the saved `History` object).
        *   Integrate these plots into the notebook and `main.py` workflow.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Ability to define, train, and save a DNN model dynamically.
    *   Basic training progress visualization (loss/accuracy curves).

**Part 3: Comprehensive Evaluation Suite**

*   **Goal:** Implement all the requested evaluation metrics and visualizations.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Metrics Suite Module (`src/evaluation/metrics_suite.py`):**
        *   Implement functions to calculate/generate data for:
            *   AUC score.
            *   Data for ROC curve (FPR, TPR, thresholds).
            *   Confusion Matrix data.
            *   Classification Report data.
            *   Data for Precision-Recall curve.
    2.  **Advanced Plotting Module (`src/evaluation/plots.py`):**
        *   Implement functions to plot:
            *   ROC curve (with AUC).
            *   Confusion Matrix (heatmap).
            *   Precision-Recall curve.
    3.  **Feature Importance (`src/evaluation/metrics_suite.py` & `src/evaluation/plots.py`):**
        *   Implement permutation feature importance (using `sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance`).
        *   Implement a function to plot feature importances.
    4.  **Integrate into Colab Notebook & `main.py`:**
        *   Update workflows to:
            *   Load the trained model.
            *   Make predictions on the test set.
            *   Calculate all metrics using `metrics_suite`.
            *   Generate and save/display all plots using `plots`.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   A full suite of evaluation metrics and corresponding visualizations for model performance assessment.

**Part 4: Advanced Features, Tuning & Refinement**

*   **Goal:** Add hyperparameter tuning capabilities and refine the overall application.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Hyperparameter Tuning Module (`src/tuning/hyperparameter_search.py`):**
        *   Implement Grid Search functionality (e.g., using `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` with a Keras wrapper or Keras Tuner).
        *   The function should take a parameter grid from `config.py`.
        *   It needs to be able to use the `dnn_builder` function.
        *   Output the best parameters and best score.
    2.  **EDA Module Enhancement (`src/eda/exploratory_analysis.py`):**
        *   Add more sophisticated EDA functions (e.g., correlation heatmaps, distribution plots for specific features, pair plots).
    3.  **Configuration Enhancement (`src/config.py`):**
        *   Refine `config.py` to be more comprehensive, perhaps loading from YAML/JSON for easier management of complex configurations (e.g., different datasets, multiple model architectures).
    4.  **Utilities (`src/utils/helpers.py`):**
        *   Implement helper functions for saving/loading Python objects (e.g., fitted scalers, encoders, models if not using Keras's save format exclusively).
        *   Basic logging setup.
    5.  **Refine Colab Notebook & `main.py`:**
        *   Incorporate grid search into the workflow.
        *   Allow selection of different configurations for runs.
        *   Improve output organization (saving reports, models, plots in structured directories within `outputs/`).
    6.  **Documentation & Testing (Ongoing):**
        *   Add docstrings to functions and modules.
        *   Consider writing basic unit tests for critical components (e.g., data loading, a simple transformation).
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Ability to perform grid search for hyperparameter optimization.
    *   More robust EDA capabilities.
    *   A more polished and configurable end-to-end pipeline.

This 4-part plan allows for incremental development and testing at each stage. We can adjust the specifics within each part as we go.
